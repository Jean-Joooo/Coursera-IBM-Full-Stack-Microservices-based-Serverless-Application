Microservices Serverless IBM Coursera Full Stack :

I Deployed a Python application using the Code Engine CLI :

Firstly, I opened a Code Engine CLI. Then, I Deployed the application using commands specific to each directory. I Observed the deployment progress and ensured successful deployment.
Following that, I deployed the front-end application sourced from dealer_evaluation_frontend. Adjusted the index.html file by replacing placeholder URLs with deployment.
At the end, I Loaded the home page, selected a product and dealer, and obtained prices. Explored further by getting prices for all dealers of a specific product.

The microservices serverless deployment ensures smooth communication between back-end and front-end components. Followed the steps to achieve a fully functional application.
